This project is an offline AI-powered assistant that helps users learn and explore Python programming by answering questions using Python’s built-in documentation system.
Users can type in the name of any Python function, module, method, or keyword — and the bot instantly provides detailed documentation using Python’s pydoc module. No internet connection or external API is required.
